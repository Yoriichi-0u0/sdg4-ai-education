            <h2>Access is shaped by infrastructure, skills, and policy</h2>
            <p>
              Access is shaped first by infrastructure and affordability. Patchy broadband or 4G, unreliable electricity, and high data costs make simple tasks like watching a short explanation or joining a ten minute check in feel risky. Families that own a single smartphone cannot serve multiple school schedules, and topping up data competes with essentials (UNICEF &amp; ITU, 2020; GSMA Intelligence, 2024).
            </p>
            <p>
              School readiness and digital skills add a second layer. Device pools are small, technical support is thin, and materials are not always accessible by default. Parents and students who are new to learning platforms spend time on navigation and account issues, which reduces time on tasks that actually build knowledge (UNICEF, 2020; UNICEF Office of Research Innocenti, 2025).
            </p>
            <p>
              Policy design is the third piece. Few systems guarantee a measurable minimum level of access. Procurement for assistive technology is slow or one off, and emergency device programs often lack maintenance budgets. Environmental factors such as power cuts and monsoon season outages make continuity harder unless the whole system is planned for low bandwidth and offline use. Countries that treat foundational access as part of foundational learning see more stable recovery and better equity outcomes (World Bank, 2025; UNICEF UK, 2021).

            <h2>Adoption, governance, and equity guardrails</h2>
            <p>
              Adoption is driven by real classroom pressures. Teachers juggle large classes, diverse reading levels, and limited time for individual feedback. AI tutors promise extra practice sets, hints, and explanations on demand. When these tools align with curriculum goals and are checked for quality, they can increase time on task and help students correct errors sooner, a mechanism that underpins learning gains (Ma et al., 2014; <a href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/features/edu-a0037123.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">American Psychological Association</a>).
            </p>
            <p>
              Technology maturity and governance shape outcomes. General-purpose models are powerful but can hallucinate facts and produce plausible-sounding mistakes. Policy guidance emphasises a human-in-the-loop approach, transparency about when AI is used, and safeguards against bias and harmful content. Systems should be auditable, age-appropriate, and designed so teachers can see what the tool suggested and why (<a href="https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000386693" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UNESCO, 2023</a>; <a href="https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/2023/12/oecd-digital-education-outlook-2023_c827b81a.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OECD, 2023</a>).
            </p>
            <p>
              Equity and privacy are the other major factors. If AI tutors require high bandwidth, new devices, or broad data collection, they deepen access gaps and create unnecessary risks for minors. Child-centred guidance calls for data minimisation, clear consent, and the best interests of the child as the primary design principle. National regulators add age-appropriate design standards that edtech tools should meet before use in schools (<a href="https://www.unicef.org/innocenti/reports/policy-guidance-ai-children" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UNICEF, 2021</a>; <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/childrens-information/childrens-code-guidance-and-resources/age-appropriate-design-a-code-of-practice-for-online-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UK Information Commissioner’s Office, 2020</a>).

            <h2>Skills focus, design quality, and system capacity</h2>
            <p>
              Adoption is driven by a skills shift. Employers and curricula emphasise problem solving, communication, and ethical decision making, which are poorly captured by recall-only quizzes. Authentic assessment maps naturally to these outcomes because students must produce, test, and defend work, not merely recite facts (Koh, 2017; <a href="https://oxfordre.com/education/display/10.1093/acrefore/9780190264093.001.0001/acrefore-9780190264093-e-22" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oxford Research Encyclopedias</a>).
            </p>
            <p>
              Quality depends on design and scoring. Strong tasks align with learning outcomes, publish transparent criteria, and generate reliable scores through shared rubrics, exemplars, moderation, and rater training (Darling-Hammond, 2013; Guha et al., 2018). Programme-wide tools such as the AAC&amp;U VALUE framework offer common language while preserving authentic performance in context (<a href="https://www.aacu.org/value/rubrics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AAC&amp;U, n.d.</a>).
            </p>
            <p>
              Capacity and systems matter. Faculty need time and support to redesign tasks, practise rubric use, and manage feedback at scale. Teacher assessment literacy and supportive policy are known levers for embedding authentic assessment sustainably (<a href="https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark%3A/48223/pf0000388275" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UNESCO, 2023</a>).

            <h2>Classroom realities, policy design, and tool quality</h2>
            <p>
              Teacher time is shaped first by classroom realities. Large classes, mixed readiness levels, and behaviour management all compete with the minutes available for feedback and planning. When admin tasks stack on top, teachers spend more time on clerical work and less on instruction, which keeps stress high year after year (<a href="https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RRA1100/RRA1108-12/RAND_RRA1108-12.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RAND, 2024</a>).
            </p>
            <p>
              System design and policy are the second layer. How ministries and districts define required paperwork, meeting loads, and reporting cycles sets the default. OECD analyses point to time regulations, duty allocation, and simplification of compliance tasks as levers that materially change how the week is used (<a href="https://www.oecd.org/content/dam/oecd/en/publications/reports/2021/01/making-the-most-of-teachers-time_e0e7a8ec/d005c027-en.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OECD, 2021a</a>; <a href="https://www.oecd.org/content/dam/oecd/en/publications/reports/2021/01/not-enough-hours-in-the-day_4ebd6b3d/15990b42-en.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OECD, 2021b</a>).
            </p>
            <p>
              Technology quality and governance are the third layer. Poorly chosen platforms create duplicate data entry and new chores, while well-designed tools automate rostering, low-stakes marking, and routine communication. International guidance stresses that technology should reduce workload and increase instructional time, with humans reviewing outputs to avoid errors, bias, and privacy risks (<a href="https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark%3A/48223/pf0000385723" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UNESCO, 2023</a>).

            <p class="case-section__kicker">Case 5</p>
            <h2>Design choices, governance, and capacity define privacy</h2>
            <p>
              The first factor is design choice. Many platforms default to broad data capture, long retention, and third-party sharing. When defaults are open rather than minimal, the system drifts toward surveillance and function creep. UNICEF’s child-centred policy guidance sets nine requirements for responsible data and AI systems, including data minimisation, safety by design, and transparency that families can understand (<a href="https://www.unicef.org/innocenti/reports/policy-guidance-ai-children" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UNICEF Innocenti, 2021</a>).
            </p>
            <p>
              Governance is the second factor. Countries sit at very different stages on law and enforcement. The UK’s Age-Appropriate Design Code offers fifteen standards for services used by under-18s—high privacy by default, data protection impact assessments, and geolocation off unless it serves the child’s best interest. These expectations are a practical reference for schools and vendors everywhere (<a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/childrens-information/childrens-code-guidance-and-resources/age-appropriate-design-a-code-of-practice-for-online-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Information Commissioner’s Office, 2020</a>).
            </p>
            <p>
              System capacity completes the picture. Education authorities often lack time and tools to audit vendors or align classroom deployments with policy. OECD’s Digital Education Outlook stresses building data and technology governance that earns public trust, sets clear accountability, and prevents privacy breaches as systems scale AI and analytics (<a href="https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/oecd-digital-education-outlook-2023_c74f03de-en/full-report/data-and-technology-governance-fostering-trust-in-the-use-of-data_171e56b9.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OECD, 2023</a>).
