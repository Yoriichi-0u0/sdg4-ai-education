              <h3>Ethics</h3>
              <p>
                Ethics gives the first lens. Distributive justice asks whether the basic means of learning are fairly allocated. If practice time and feedback depend on family income or postcode, the system is not only unequal but unjust. A rights based view treats baseline access to devices, connectivity, and assistive tools as part of the right to learn, which aligns with child centered guidance from international bodies and with national recovery strategies that put foundational learning first (UNICEF, 2020; World Bank, 2025).
              </p>

            <div class="case-topic">
              <h3>Logic</h3>
              <p>
                Logic helps to clean up the conversation. Many debates fall into a false choice that frames learning as in person or digital. The better design is blended and offline first. Another error treats possession of a device as equivalent to effective access. A phone with no data and a failing battery does not provide the same opportunity as a stable laptop connection. Clearer reasoning avoids shallow indicators and keeps the focus on time on task and quality of feedback (Avanesian et al., 2021; UNICEF &amp; ITU, 2020).

            <div class="case-topic">
              <h3>Epistemology</h3>
              <p>
                Epistemology asks what counts as evidence of learning when participation is constrained. Missing submissions do not always mean missing understanding. Camera off does not always mean disengagement. Assessment needs multiple low bandwidth ways for students to show what they know, for example short voice notes, photos of handwritten work, or quick offline quizzes that sync later. This keeps grades reliable and keeps knowledge tied to performance rather than to bandwidth (UNICEF Office of Research Innocenti, 2025; UNICEF, 2020).

            <div class="case-topic">
              <h3>Critical perspectives</h3>
              <p>
                Critical perspectives warn against techno solutionism. One device per child does not fix pedagogy, maintenance, language access, or teacher workload. Digital colonialism can appear when platforms ignore local languages and contexts. A reflective stance favors locally relevant content, shared governance of data, and partnerships that build capacity rather than dependency, which is a theme across child rights and equity focused guidance on digital learning (UNICEF Office of Research Innocenti, 2025; UNICEF UK, 2021).

              <p>
                Beneficence asks whether AI tutors improve learning for all, not only students with the latest devices. Non-maleficence requires that foreseeable harms such as biased or false outputs are avoided. Justice demands equal opportunity to benefit, which means pairing tools with access support and privacy protections for minors (<a href="https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000386693" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UNESCO, 2023</a>; <a href="https://www.unicef.org/innocenti/reports/policy-guidance-ai-children" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UNICEF, 2021</a>).

              <h3>Logic</h3>
              <p>
                AI can produce fluent but invalid arguments. Students should be taught to check premises, detect non sequiturs, and verify citations. Teachers can use AI outputs as fallacy-spotting exercises, helping learners identify weak inference and repair the argument. Policy briefs stress the importance of critical evaluation of AI responses rather than uncritical acceptance (<a href="https://www.ed.gov/sites/ed/files/documents/ai-report/ai-report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. Department of Education, 2023</a>).

              <p>
                When an AI can draft an answer instantly, reliable knowledge still requires justified, true belief supported by evidence and process. Classroom routines should require students to show steps, explain why a method works, and cross-check sources so that AI becomes a tool for inquiry instead of a substitute for understanding (<a href="https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000386693" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UNESCO, 2023</a>).

                Avoid techno-solutionism and imported defaults that ignore local curricula and languages. Prioritise culturally relevant content, shared data governance, and capacity building so schools are not locked into opaque systems. International guidance argues for human-centred, context-aware deployment that respects national priorities and community values (<a href="https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/guidance-generative-ai-education-and-research" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UNESCO, 2023</a>; <a href="https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/2023/12/oecd-digital-education-outlook-2023_c827b81a.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OECD, 2023</a>).

                <p>
                  Authentic assessment supports fairness by giving students multiple ways to show what they know and can do. Justice is strengthened when criteria are transparent, bias is checked through moderation, and tasks are accessible, aligning with international guidance that frames assessment as a lever for equity (<a href="https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark%3A/48223/pf0000388275" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UNESCO, 2023</a>).

                <h3>Logic</h3>
                <p>
                  Wiggins argues that authentic tasks assess what they claim to assess because they require the actual performance, not a proxy. This corrects the logical fallacy of treating ease of scoring as proof of validity, positioning performance evidence as the stronger argument for complex skills (Wiggins, 1990; Darling-Hammond, 2013).

                <p>
                  Knowing is framed as justified performance that integrates concepts, skills, and evidence. Students must explain why a solution works, compare alternatives, and defend choices against criteria, echoing scholarship on authentic assessment and program-level rubrics (<a href="https://oxfordre.com/education/display/10.1093/acrefore/9780190264093.001.0001/acrefore-9780190264093-e-22" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Koh, 2017</a>; AAC&amp;U, n.d.).

                <p>
                  Authentic tasks can reduce dependence on imported test formats by valuing local contexts, languages, and problems. When communities co-design tasks and criteria, assessment honours diverse ways of demonstrating competence while retaining rigour through shared standards and moderation (Guha et al., 2018).

                <p>
                  Teacher time is a duty of care issue. When systems knowingly overload educators with clerical tasks, they harm wellbeing and reduce the feedback students receive. Justice also applies because time is a resource that should be distributed where need is greatest (<a href="https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/results-from-talis-2024_90df6235-en.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OECD, 2025</a>; <a href="https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RRA1100/RRA1108-12/RAND_RRA1108-12.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RAND, 2024</a>).

                <p>
                  Workload debates often assume that adding technology automatically frees time. The valid test is whether minutes on instruction and feedback actually rise after adoption. If parallel systems or extra data entry appear, the inference fails and the tool should be reconsidered (<a href="https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark%3A/48223/pf0000385723" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UNESCO, 2023</a>; <a href="https://www.oecd.org/content/dam/oecd/en/publications/reports/2021/01/making-the-most-of-teachers-time_e0e7a8ec/d005c027-en.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OECD, 2021a</a>).

                <p>
                  Better time use improves the quality of evidence about learning. When teachers reclaim minutes for formative checks, conferencing, and moderation, judgements about what students know rest on richer observation rather than thin proxies (<a href="https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark%3A/48223/pf0000385723" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UNESCO, 2023</a>).

                A rights-based view says children have a right to privacy and to a learning environment that promotes their best interests. That means data minimisation, meaningful consent processes, and protections that do not rely on families reading legalistic policies. UNICEF’s guidance and the UN’s interpretation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child extend these duties to the digital realm (<a href="https://www.unicef.org/innocenti/reports/policy-guidance-ai-children" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UNICEF Innocenti, 2021</a>; <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/documents/general-comments-and-recommendations/general-comment-no-25-2021-childrens-rights-relation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Committee on the Rights of the Child, 2021</a>).

                Do not confuse a consent click with informed consent. If a service is mandatory for class and the privacy notice is opaque, consent is not freely given. Another fallacy claims that more tracking equals more safety. The UNESCO Global Education Monitoring Report demonstrates that heavy surveillance often introduces new risks rather than solving underlying pedagogy (<a href="https://gem-report-2023.unesco.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UNESCO, 2023</a>).

                Learning analytics can be useful, yet data are not knowledge by themselves. Schools should ask whether indicators are valid for the outcomes that matter and whether they introduce bias. Evidence must be interpretable, auditable, and open to challenge, especially when analytics inform high-stakes decisions (<a href="https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/oecd-digital-education-outlook-2023_c74f03de-en/full-report/data-and-technology-governance-fostering-trust-in-the-use-of-data_171e56b9.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OECD, 2023</a>).

                Guard against data extraction models that treat classrooms as sources of value for distant platforms. Prioritise local relevance, shared governance of data, and community oversight. UNESCO’s privacy work argues for balancing the benefits of technology with the protection of individual rights, favouring context-aware approaches over one-size-fits-all imports (<a href="https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark%3A/48223/pf0000381494" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UNESCO, 2022</a>).
